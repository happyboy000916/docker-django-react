# docker-django-react

WORK IN PROGRESS. HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL.

A local dev fullstack template for docker-compose with Django and React. Keeping it all in one repo for ease of use. The following are the steps I had in mind for using it as a project template:

1. Create a new repo on GitHub
2. On your local dev machine, and in your preferred parent directory:

```text

$> git clone <url-original-remote-repo> <new-local-repo-dir>
$> cd <new-local-repo-dir>
$> git remote add origin <url-new-remote-repo-created-in-step-1>
$> git push -u origin master

```
